# Take-A-Pause Chrome Extension - Misha Ward
This coding project is designed to create a Chrome Extension that addresses the following requirements from my client:

*  Create a timer for x minutes that alerts the user via a screen popup on chrome
*  Once that timer is completed, it should kick off another timer that the user sets for another x amount of time
*  Future iterations should have a way to have multiple timers for the user to set
*  Those multiple timers should have the option to reset indefinitely

Although this project has started, please feel free to message me about any issues or questions about the next steps in completing this Chrome Extension.

## Instructions to Run
This program can be tested by downloading the codebase, and then uploading the Remind-Me-Later Chrome Extension to the following website: *chrome://extensions/*. After the upload works, you should be able to see a new Chrome Extension icon appear in the top right corner of your Chrome browser.

## Next Steps
While the Chrome Extension works and meets the critical specifications above, there are some areas of improvement that could be included in the next steps. These are listed below:

**Completed: 12/9/2019**
* Allow for audio noise when alarm goes off

**Remaining Work To Be Completed**
* Better input format for reminder timer - one line input
* Create functionality for multiple reminders
* Create functionality for repeating or turning off the reminder
* Updates to the UI of the extension
* Fix misc. bugs in the program, build tests/testing suite
